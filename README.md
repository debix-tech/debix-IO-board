- Handle with care to avoid mechanical or electrical damage to the circuit board and connectors.
- Only handle the board by the edges when powered on to minimize the risk of electrostatic discharge damage.

**Environment:**
- Operate in a well-ventilated environment, even if using a case.
- Place on a stable, flat, non-conductive surface and avoid contact with conductive items.

**Connections:**
- Only connect compatible devices to the GPIO ports to avoid damage and warranty voiding.
- Use peripherals that comply with relevant standards for the country of use and ensure proper insulation and operation.

**Additional notes:**
- This summary is not exhaustive, please refer to the full User Manual for details.
